Base Wordpress


The original idea behind this was to make a working start up for all my themes, but I got carried away with a clients job, so it's more customized than I originally intended. Oh well! I will do another one when I have time. 

In the meantime, I used Bootstrap 3, Codekit, Less, Bower, and other good stuff to work on this.
